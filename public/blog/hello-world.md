## Why MacPacker?

MacPacker was created to fill a gap in the macOS ecosystem. While Apple's built-in Archive Utility handles basic ZIP files, Mac users working with RAR, 7z, and other modern archive formats needed a better solution.

MacPacker is:
- **Free and Open Source** — No hidden costs, no limitations, and full transparency
- **Native macOS Design** — Built specifically for macOS with support for Dark Mode and modern macOS features
- **Powerful Yet Simple** — Handles 30+ archive formats while maintaining an intuitive, easy-to-use interface
- **Privacy-Focused** — No ads, no tracking, no telemetry — your files stay on your Mac

## What's Next?

We have an exciting content roadmap planned for the coming weeks and months:

- In-depth guides for each supported archive format
- Automation tips for power users and developers
- Performance comparison articles
- User success stories and use cases
- Best practices for archive organization

## Stay Connected

We're committed to making MacPacker the best archive manager for macOS, and this blog is an important part of that mission. Whether you're a casual user extracting the occasional archive or a power user managing hundreds of files daily, we're here to help you work smarter.
