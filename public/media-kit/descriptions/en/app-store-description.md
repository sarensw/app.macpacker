# MacPacker - Archive Manager for macOS

Preview and extract files from any archive format on macOS. Free, open source, and built for simplicity.

## Key Features

**Nested Archive Preview**
See inside archives without extracting them—even when they're nested inside other archives. Navigate ZIP files containing RAR files containing 7z files, all without unpacking anything.

**Extract Single Files**
Pull out just the files you need instead of extracting everything. Save time and disk space.

**25+ Supported Formats**
Works with all common archive and disk image formats:
- **Compression:** ZIP, RAR, 7z, GZIP, LZ4, LZX, SEA, XAR
- **Disk Images:** DMG, ISO, VDI, VMDK, VHDX, QCOW2, APFS, FAT, NTFS, VHD
- **Archives:** TAR, TAR.BZ2, TAR.LZ4, TAR.XZ, TAR.Z, CPIO, SquashFS
- **Other:** ARJ, CAB, CHM, LHA, LZH, SIT

**Quick Look Integration**
Preview archives directly in Finder with Quick Look (Space bar).

**Multilingual Support**
Available in English, German, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese (Simplified), and Persian (Farsi). Community translations welcome.
