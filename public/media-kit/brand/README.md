# MacPacker Brand Assets

Official brand assets for MacPacker — an open-source archive manager for macOS.

## Logo Variants

### Icon (Square Format)

Use the icon variants for app listings, social media profiles, and small display contexts.

- **logo-icon.svg** — Scalable vector format (recommended for all uses)
- **logo-icon-512.png** — 512×512px PNG (high-resolution displays)
- **logo-icon-256.png** — 256×256px PNG (standard displays)
- **logo-icon-128.png** — 128×128px PNG (small thumbnails)

### Full Logo (Horizontal Format)

Use the full logo variants for headers, marketing materials, and presentations.

- **logo-full.svg** — For light backgrounds (dark logo on transparent)
- **logo-full-dark.svg** — For dark backgrounds (light logo on transparent)

## Clear Space Requirements

Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the icon itself. This ensures the logo has proper breathing room and remains visually distinct from surrounding elements.

**Example:**
- For a 48px tall logo, maintain at least 48px of clear space on all sides
- For a 128px tall logo, maintain at least 128px of clear space on all sides

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ Allowed

- Scale the logo proportionally (maintain aspect ratio)
- Use logo-full.svg on light backgrounds (white, light gray, light colors)
- Use logo-full-dark.svg on dark backgrounds (black, dark gray, dark colors)
- Use SVG format whenever possible for best quality at any size
- Place logo on solid, uncluttered backgrounds

### ❌ Not Allowed

- Do not stretch, skew, or distort the logo

- Do not add effects (drop shadows, gradients, glows, outlines)
- Do not place the logo on busy or low-contrast backgrounds
